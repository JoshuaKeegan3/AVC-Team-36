|MAY 26 TUES|20 mins|Team member Josh contacted me and the rest of the team via email to sort out a means of communication, we decided on Facebook messenger. Josh also made a group chat with 4/5 team members. We could not get in contact with the last team member. So far the known team members are Josh, Jasmine and me|<li> ~Get in contact with last two team members [COMPLETED: 28/05]~ <li> ~Ensure I've read through the lecture slides and watched the necessary lectures for this project [COMPLETED: 30/05]~|
|MAY 28 THURS|N/A|Today we got into contact with the last two team members, Deepika and Michael, and Josh added them into the Project 3 Facebook Messenger group chat. Josh also let us know that we need to be using GitHub for the project, so we need to sort that out in the near future.|<li> ~Make group GitHub repository for project. [COMPLETED: 3/06]~|
|MAY 29 FRI|1 hour 30 mins|Josh made a Google Doc for our plan and shared it with us. The plan template on the Project 3 page was copy and pasted into the Doc. I also made my way through 1 and a half of the lectures regrading this project and followed along with the slides whilst watching.|<li> ~Finish the rest of the lectures and slides [COMPLETED: 30/05]~|
|MAY 30 SAT|1 hour 55 mins|Today I made my way through the rest of the slides and lectures for this project and saw that we need to use GitHub for our project. I've used GitHub before but the last time I used it was 2 years ago so I need to refamiliarise myself with that. My group sorted out a time and date for our first group meeting today. We decided on tomorrow at 1pm. I've also read through the project page and have started a proper individual log in my personal planner and have written the details of each day since I was first contacted by my team members (26 May) to now. I will continue to use both my planner from now on for my individual log rather than an Excel as it is easier for me to keep track of.|<li> ~Meet group members via Zoom [COMPLETED: 31/05]~ <li> ~Explore GitHub and get to know the basics. [COMPLETED: 1/06]~|
|MAY 31 SUN |1 hour - 1 hour and 30 mins|Today my group had our first meeting via Zoom, Deepika couldn't make the meeting due to work. In the meeting, we introduced ourselves and got to know each other. We also talked about how we were going to approach the project and our strategies for it. Today, I downloaded the AVC_Win10 folder from the project website and am in the process of installing the necessary software onto my computer. I've been following the instructions on the Project 3 webpage to help me with this.|<li> ~Finish software installation process. [COMPLETED: 2/06]~|
|JUNE 1 MON|45 mins|Today I had a brief play around with GitHub. I am starting to remember the controls of it and what they do.| |
|JUNE 2 TUES|1 hour|Today I communicated with my team members through Facebook Messenger and Josh checked up on the rest of the members who are using Windows as there has apparently been a problem with other peers getting compilation errors and their games not responding. I think I might've gotten my software to work on my laptop, however when I try to 'make' my files on Geany no compilation errors show up but I don't get a message saying that the programs have compiled successfully either. So I'm not quite sure if that's suppose to be happening but I will go to a lab to check if I've installed everything right. The team roles have also been distributed, I am doing the software writing, testing and debugging with Deepika. I'm not quite sure what a test case is, which is a part of my role so I will have to ask someone or research about that soon.|<li> ~Go to a lab and check if I've installed everything correctly. [COMPLETED: 4/06]~|
|JUNE 3 WED|45 mins|I didn't get to go to a lab today as I had a ENGR121 and COMP102 assignments due and I'd been working on them the whole day. While I was taking a break I tried to work on my program. I'd installed everything but when I tried to run server3.cpp, a global view and camera view of the course open but it doesn't actaully display anything but I can see that they are open in my computer's task bar. I asked the rest of my group for help with this and they tried to help me but my program still wasn't working, so I will definitely have to go to a lab soon to get this sorted. The plan is also due tomorrow but most of it has already been done it just needs to be finished up. I also started my research on test cases today and have also asked a few other classmates who are doing the AVC project about test cases and have better idea on what they are. But I need to double check with a tutor or Arthur about them just in case the project requires something a bit different Josh also made a GitHub repository for our team today which the whole team and Arthur have access to.|<li> ~Finish off project plan [COMPLETED: 4/06]~ <li> ~Go to a lab to sort program [COMPLETED: 4/06]~
& ~ask about test cases [COMPLETED: 11/06]~|
|JUNE 4 THURS|1 hour 30 mins| I went to all the labs today and tried to get my program sorted with Arthur but we couldn't seem to figure out what was wrong. I also went to the lecture today where Arthur showed us how to install the programs. Since the lecture was recorded, I'm rewatching it so I can follow along with the installation process. I deleted everything I've previously done (AVC_Win10 folder, Mingw64 program, SFML) so I can start fresh in case I did install something wrong. The project plan has been finished. There was also a lecture on today but I did not get to watch it as I had been working on my COMP assignment that I had an extension for. We also sorted out next meeting via Messenger, we have decided on tomorrow at 1pm.|<li> Finish installation process.|
|JUNE 5 FRI|2 hours and 30 mins|The group had our meeting a bit later than planned today as some of us were in labs, so we had a Zoom meeting around 1.30pm. In the meeting, we talked about how we were going to approach core of the project. The team decided that they were going to split the four functions that need to be written for core and program them. That is to be finished by Sunday, which was the day we decided to have our next meeting. Unfortunately, I couldn't even start writing any code as I still didn't have my software working. I let the rest of my team members know this and they suggested that I leave the meeting early to go to the lab that was on at the same time as our meeting. So I left the meeting and went to the lab and got a tutor to help me with my software. I'm not quite sure what happened in the rest of the meeting, but I'll check the Messenger group chat and the GitHub log to see what I missed. Because I came already an hour into the lab, the tutor and I couldn't get my software sorted before the lab was finished. Before I left the lab Arthur suggested to follow the nice.mp4 video and try again. So after the lab I started again and deleted all my files again and redownloaded everything of the project 3 website again so I didn't get anything mixed up. I followed the nice.mp4 video step by step twice and turned off my antivirus in case that was the problem but I still couldn't get my program to work. I worked on this until 1.30AM before emailing Arthur as I had tried what I could and but nothing was working :((|<li> Figure out what is wrong with program and get it to work [PRIORITY] <li> ~Check to see if Arthur has replied to email [COMPLETED: 6/06]~<li> ~Check what happened during the rest of the group meeting.[COMPLETED: 6/06]~|
|JUNE 6 SAT|1 hour and 10 minutes|I checked the group chat this morning to see if there were any updates but there were none on there but I read through the GitHub log and caught myself up on what has happened. Arthur hasn't replied to my yet so while I'm waiting on that I've researched more into test cases as I haven't gotten the chance to ask a tutor or Arthur yet. Josh finished core of the project which is great news but the test cases for core are not written yet so I need to make a start on those. The team has a meeting tomorrow so I'll discuss the test cases with everyone then.|<li> Discuss test cases with team.|
|JUNE 8 MON|2 hours and 30 mins|Arthur replied to my email today and suggested that I edit my Windows path, so I did that and but it still didn't work. So I talked to Arthur in the lab today to see if we can get my software sorted today but unfortunately we couldn't. So Arthur told me to zip my project 3 folders, upload it onto the project GitHub and send him a link so he can try run it. Whilst trying to upload my zipped folder to GitHub I found out that I didn't actually have access to the project repository. I was able to view it but I couldn't edit anything. But Josh invited me to the GitHub and I was able to sort that out. But I ended up just uploading my folder to Outlook as the file was too big for GitHub and emailing a link to Arthur. Arthur replied a few hours later and gave me a new folder that had a few changes. I downloaded the folder to my computer and followed his instructions in the email. My program still isn't working but at least it's now showing up with a compilation error, compared to before where it woulldn't show up with anything at all. I've emailed Arthur again about it to see if he see what the problem is.|<li> Check if Arthur has replied to email|
|JUNE 9 TUES|15 mins|I checked my email and Arthur has replied and told me to try deleting my robot.o and server.o files. I did this and my program finally worked!! I need to let the rest of the team know so they know that I can start testing. The meeting was cancelled on Sunday so the team decided to have a meeting today at 1PM. In the meeting we talked about the test cases and decided what to do them on. I'm doing a test case on 'how well does the robot follow the white line? Is it constantly correcting itself?' I will need to get the this test case done by our meeting on Friday, where we will be reading through them. We also contacted through the Messenger group chat and decided that our next meeting would be on Thursday at around 3.30PM.|<li> ~Let team know that my code is working. [COMPLETED: 11/06]~<li> ~Start test case.[COMPLETED: 11/06]~|
|JUNE 11 THURS|1 hour 22 mins|We had our team meeting today, where Jasmine checked up on the test cases. I also let the team know that my software is now working then. I started the test cases today and am in the process of doing the testing part. I've copy and pasted the robot.cpp file on the GitHub master branch to test the code. However, the code isn't working on my device for some reason. My robot is only travelling in a straight line. As far as I know it's working properly on the rest of the team's devices. I need to get this sorted as the core test cases need to be finished soon so we can move on to the completion test cases. I also had a look around at the GitHub and saw that some team members are putting their individual log on GitHub so I will have to get around to cross writing my individual logs on GitHub. I finally got around to asking Arthur about test cases and I think I understand how to go about them better.|<li> ~Ask team members about whether I'm even copying the right code from the repository. [COMPLETED: 12/06]~ <li> ~Finish up test cases and commit to GitHub [COMPLETED: 12/06]~ <li> ~Start committing my individual logs to GitHub [COMPLETED: 12/06]~|
|JUNE 12 FRI|3 hours| I tried Josh's latest commit, core.cpp today in Geany for the testing part of the test cases, just in case I did copy and paste the wrong code to test. However the robot still only travels in a straight line, which is weird as the code is working fine for the others. Turns out there was no team Zoom meeting today, so I couldn't ask the team about this during the meeting. I asked the team Messenger group chat whether I need to copy any additional files from the repository but got told that I did not, so I am lost as to what is wrong. I worked on it further to try see what is wrong but I am still lost, I will need to ask my team about it during the Sunday meeting. It's likely my device is the problem, if the problems persist I may need to talk to the rest of the team about another member doing the testing parts of the test cases as I am unable to do them myself. Because of this I've only written the testing part of my test case for half of the scenarios as I'm only going off of videos of core sent on the group chat as well as the demontrations over Zoom call. But I've committed what I'm able to do on GitHub. I've also started committing my individual log to GitHub but it's taking a while due to the formatting and my lack of knowledge on how to format on GitHub. Ccommiting my planner content is taking even longer as I am not able to copy and paste my planner. I'm also adding to the formatting of my test cases for core so it looks more like the test case template I found in the following website: https://bit.ly/37tImgg . Will need to ask the rest of the team members if they are happy with the format after commiting the new format.| <li> ~Finish committing individual logs to GitHub. [COMPLETED: 14/06]~ <li> Do reformatting of core test cases. [COMPLETED: __/06]|
|JUNE 13 SAT|Around 5 hours| I've been working on writing up my log on for a good portion of the day and did not get chance to do the reformatting of the test cases. Will work on that soon.|<li> Spell check individual logs [COMPLETED: __/06]|
|JUNE 14 SUN|1 hour|I've finally finshed committing my individual logs onto GitHub.| |
