organsing group meetings and regularly updating the project log.

Over these past couple of days, I tried to download the SFML library so I was able to help code the robot through the maze. As I am on a 
windows device, I encountered a few difficulties with the installation. I ended up going to a lab and get help by sharing my screen with 
the tutor. Took a few attempts but turns out that I needed to download a different mingw which was more compatible. Once I finally got it 
working, I started on my team plan.

Today I spent about two hours working on the plan so it was thorough. I started by writing out the team and their details and then I 
started drafting up a timeline of rough dates that we want things completed by. 
to be completed

We met as a team again today to discuss ideas for core over zoom. The call lasted for around an hour and a half where we discussed the
functions that we were going to use and how we wanted to approach the core. I also try to help some of the members in my group with 
installing the SFML library and tried to fix their errors.
