# Project-3-Team-36
## AVC Plan
ENGR101 Project 3 - "The purpose of this project is to write a software which guides a robot through a maze."  

### Communication  
We have decided as a group to meet on Friday between 1-3 pm to work on the code for our project. We have made a group chat on Facebook messenger which will be our main form of communication when we have made progress, and want to report back to the group about. If we believe we need to meet as a group twice a week via zoom, Tuesday between 1-3 pm is the next alternative option.

### Deadlines to note

| Hand-ins | Date | Course mark |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Plan | Thurs 4th May | |
| Code due | Fri 19th May | 5%|
| Team Log | Wed 24th May | 5% |
| Individual Log | Wed 24th May  | 5% |

### Interferances to note
| Conflicts | Due Date | 
|----------|------|
| ENGR101 Tutorial 4 | Mon 1st May |
| ENGR 121 Assignment 6 | Wed 3rd May |
| COMP Assignment 7/6+7 | Thurs 4th May |
| ENGR 121 Lab 3 | Fri 5th May  |
| CYBR 171 Assignment 2 | Mon 8th May  |
| ENGR 121 Assignment 7| Wed 10th May  |
| Comp Assignment 8 | Thrus 11th May  |
| CYBR ENGR Test 2 | Wed 17th May  |
| Comp Assignment 9/8+9 | Mon 18th May  |

Note the large gap between the 11th and the 17th. This is where we should be getting a lot of work done and can be treated as both a catch up and a get ahead period for the project. Challenge code may be written in this time. If this happens challenge test case creation will have to be accerated and more minds put towards it.

After report submission is Assignment 10 for Comp and Cybr Test 2. Because of this we may want to complete the parts sooner than scheduled. 

### Timeline
Note this is a team timeline and the Invidvidual Report will have to be completed in your own time. This time is provided while finalising the Group report and logs between the Friday 19th and Wednesday 24th of May however should be worked on throughout by the individual.
